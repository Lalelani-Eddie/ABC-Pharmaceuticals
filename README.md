# Pharmaceutical Production Optimization Project

## Project Overview

This project was developed for a multi-product pharmaceutical company seeking to optimize production margins and increase profitability. The company faces challenges due to:
- Limited pricing control.
- Demand fluctuations affecting profitability.
- Complex interlinked production processes with shared raw materials and byproducts.
  
To address these, McKinsey & Co., along with our team, utilized advanced analytics and machine learning to predict production needs and optimize resource allocation. The goal was to minimize waste, reduce environmental impact, and maximize cost-efficiency.

## Objectives

1. **Predict Production Needs:** Accurately forecast daily product requirements.
2. **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Streamline use of raw materials and byproducts to reduce waste and storage needs.
3. **Increase Cost Efficiency:** Reduce operational costs by minimizing excess materials and optimizing storage for special requirements.

## Solution Components

### Machine Learning Model
- **Purpose**: Predict daily demand for each product and optimize material allocation.
- **Approach**: Developed using historical production data to analyze patterns and predict future needs.
- **Outcome**: Helps reduce waste, minimize storage costs, and meet demand efficiently.

### Web Application
- **Frontend**: Built using React to visualize predictions and operational insights.
- **Features**: Provides an intuitive interface for exploring production vs. demand, byproduct usage, and financial insights.

## Technical Stack

- **Machine Learning**: Python, scikit-learn (or preferred ML framework)
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js (if applicable)
- **Database**: MongoDB/MySQL (mention the database if relevant)

## Installation and Setup

To run the application locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repo-name
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Navigate through **Operational Insights** for production predictions and byproduct analysis.
3. View **Financial Insights** for revenue performance and cost analysis.

## Future Enhancements

- **Automated Data Refresh**: Integrate real-time data inputs for dynamic predictions.
- **Expanded Insights**: Include additional metrics on environmental impact and sustainability.
